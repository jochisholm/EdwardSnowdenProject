Where in New York City is Edward Snowden?

How we did it:

Audio: Rheaa interviewed, compiled and edited the audio interviews with Jeff and Andrew (the artists who made the Edward Snowden bust). After doing that, we came together as a group and decided what kind of narrative arc our story would follow. This led to a few sessions of workshopping some paper ideas of what our story and overall design would follow. We then landed on the idea that we should make the story more visual and audio oriented than get bogged down by a lot of extra interactive features that may distract from the nugget of the narrative.

Photo: Johanna went out and shot all the locations that the Edward Snowden bust travelled to, through a list that was provided by the artists. She then shot pictures of the artist, Howard Skrill, while he sketched a picture of the bust at the Brooklyn Museum to create a gif for the opening header of the story’s page, which was created using Photoshop’s video animation feature.

Interactive: Daniela made an interactive map that tracks where and when the Edward Snowden bust went to its different locations. The map was created on CartDB, and the data was gathered through the information provided by the artists. There are descriptions on each of the points that tells you why and how the bust got to each new location. 

Layout: We decided to host our story on Wordpress, since it has the most user friendly interface for designing webpages with lots of multimedia elements. We also know how to customize with Wordpress better than creating our own HTML page, and with all the other work we had to do for this assignment we felt it was best to limit the amount of coding we had to do also.
