Where in New York City is Edward Snowden?

How we did it:

Audio: Rheaa interviewed, compiled and edited the audio interviews with Jeff and Andrew (the artists who made the Edward Snowden bust). After doing that, we came together as a group and decided what kind of narrative arc our story would follow. This led to a few sessions of workshopping some paper ideas of what our story and overall design would follow. We then landed on the idea that we should make the story more visual and audio oriented than get bogged down by a lot of extra interactive features that may distract from the nugget of the narrative.

Photo: Johanna went out and shot all the locations that the Edward Snowden bust travelled to, through a list that was provided by the artists. She then shot pictures of the artist, Howard Skrill, while he sketched a picture of the bust at the Brooklyn Museum to create a gif for the opening header of the story’s page, which was created using Photoshop’s video animation feature.

Interactive: For the map, we considered different options and finally decided to use CartoDB because it was the more suitable software to use, based on what we wanted to show. Other softwares, like mapbox, required some coding and it was not realistic to do it within the time frame we had to submit the project. 

In CartoDB, Daniela used the option called “simple” and we just changed the settings in order to enable the description and the name of each location in the map. People can see both, the name and the description, by hovering over each location.
For each location, we used google maps to find the latitude and longitude, which we then used in CartoDB, in the "data view" tab. This is an important step of the process because without the latitude and longitude, the locations would not appear on the map

Layout: We decided to host our story on Wordpress, since it has the most user friendly interface for designing webpages with lots of multimedia elements. We also know how to customize with Wordpress better than creating our own HTML page, and with all the other work we had to do for this assignment we felt it was best to limit the amount of coding we had to do also.
